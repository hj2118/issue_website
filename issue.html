          <p><b>Pet store puppies come from puppy mills.</b><br>Responsible breeders do not sell their puppies to pet stores because they want to meet their puppy buyers in person and a majority of national breed clubs' Codes of Ethics prohibit or discourage their members from selling their dogs to pet stores. The suppliers of pet store puppites are largely "puppy mills," commercial facilities that mass-produce puppies for sale.</p>
          <p><b>Pet stores often do not disclose the origin of the puppies they sell.</b><br>Most pet stores do not disclose the true origins of their puppies.</p>

          <p><b>Puppies sold at pet stores often have serious health or psychological problems.</b><br>Some of the illnesses common to pet store puppies include zoonotic diseases which can be spread to other pets and humans. Buyers are often faced with enormous vet bills or even the death of the puppy within days or weeks of purchase. A puppy may seem healthy for months only to develop symptoms of serious congenital conditions much later. These health problems are often the result of poor breeding at puppy mills.</p>
          <p><b>Puppies are separated from mom.</b><br>Puppies in puppy mills are suddenly taken away from their mother, instead of a gradual weaning process. This separation is stressful in itself, may affect the puppyâ€™s ability to cope with other stresses, and also removes the puppy from an environment in which a lot of early learning takes place.</p>
